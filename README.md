# CS370
For this project, I developed an intelligent agent that could navigate a maze environment using reinforcement learning and neural networks. I was provided with starter code, including a basic maze environment, experience replay templates, and a model outline. I created the full Q-learning training loop, built the experience replay functionality, customized the neural network, and added structured tracking for training performance. This work reflects the broader role of computer scientists, who solve complex problems and create technologies that impact nearly every aspect of modern life. Approaching problems like a computer scientist involves understanding the problem, planning a solution, implementing it incrementally, testing thoroughly, and refining the outcome based on feedback. Through this project, I practiced systematic problem-solving by breaking down the challenge into manageable steps, continuously improving the agentâ€™s learning process. Ethically, I recognize my responsibility to build reliable, fair, and safe systems, protect user privacy, and clearly communicate any limitations. Even in a controlled environment like this project, ensuring that the agent behaves predictably highlights the importance of ethical considerations in AI development.
